Dante's Infernal Journey - (SE_19) Web Development Basics Project

Overview:
This project was developed as part of Hand-In 1/4 for the Web Development Basics course (SE_19). The objective was to create a static website based on Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, specifically focusing on the circles of Hell. Each page represents a different stage of Dante's infernal journey, starting from "Hello World" and progressing through various circles, each with its own unique theme.
