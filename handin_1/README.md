Byte's Inferno - (SE_19) Web Development Basics Project

Overview:
This project is being developed as part of Hand-In 1/4 for the Web Development Basics course (SE_19). My objective was to create a static/responsive website based on Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, specifically focusing on the circles of Hell. Each page represents a different stage of Dante's infernal journey, starting from "Hello, World!" and progressing through all 9 circles.
